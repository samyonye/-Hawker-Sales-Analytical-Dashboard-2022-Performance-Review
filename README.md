INTRODUCTION

This technical report provides a detailed analysis of sales data, customer preferences, and regional performance metrics for a business operating in multiple categories and regions. The data highlights key trends in shipping methods, product categories, customer segments, and geographic performance. The objective of this report is to identify actionable insights and provide strategic recommendations to optimize business operations, increase profitability, and enhance market positioning.


STORY OF DATA

Data Source

The data analyzed in this report is originate from an internal company database, likely maintained by the business’s sales and operations teams. This database would typically store transactional records, customer information, and inventory details, providing a holistic view of the company’s performance across various dimensions. While the specific source is not explicitly stated, the nature of the insights

Data Collection Process

The data was likely gathered through automated processes integrated into the company’s operational systems.

Data Structure

The data is likely organized in a tabular format, typical of transactional databases, with each row representing an individual transaction or aggregated metric and each column corresponding to a specific variable. Based on the insights provided, the data structure can be inferred as follows:

Rows: Each row likely represents a summarized metric at a specific level of granularity, such as total sales or profit for a particular category, customer segment, sub-category, city, state, or region. For example, one row might represent the total gross sales for the technology category, while another row represents the profit for the consumer segment.

Columns: The columns would include variables such as:

Product Category: E.g., Technology, Furniture (used to identify the top and least profitable categories).

Sub-Category: E.g., Copiers, Envelopes (used to analyze profit at a more granular level).

Customer Segment: E.g., Consumer, Home Office (used to determine the top revenue-generating segment).

Shipping Mode: E.g., Standard Class, Same-Day (used to assess customer shipping preferences).

Geographic Variables: E.g., City (New York, Philadelphia), State (California, Virginia), Region (West, Central) (used for regional performance analysis).

Financial Metrics: E.g., Gross Sales, Gross Profit (used to quantify performance across different dimensions).

Time Period: While not explicitly mentioned, the data may include a date or time period column to indicate the timeframe of the analysis (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or yearly sales).

The data may have been pre-aggregated for the purposes of the summary report, but the underlying raw data would likely be at the transactional level, with each row representing an individual sale and columns capturing details like transaction ID, customer ID, product details, and sale amount.

Important Features and Their Significance

Several key variables in the dataset are critical to the analysis, as they provide the foundation for the insights and recommendations:

Product Category and Sub-Category: These variables (e.g., Technology, Furniture, Copiers, Envelopes) allow for the identification of high- and low-performing product lines. For example, Technology’s profit of $1,454,541.98 highlights its importance to the business, while Furniture’s lower profit of $1,845,127 signals a need for strategic adjustments.

Customer Segment: This variable (e.g., Consumer, Home Office) reveals which customer groups drive revenue. The consumer segment’s gross sale of $1,161,400.35 indicates it is the primary revenue driver, while the home office segment’s lower sales of $429,653.15 suggest an opportunity for targeted growth.

Shipping Mode: The preference for standard class over same-day shipping provides insight into customer behavior, indicating a price-sensitive market that values cost over speed.

Geographic Variables (City, State, Region): These variables (e.g., New York, California, West region) enable a geographic analysis of performance. For instance, California’s gross profit of $763,80.42 and the West region’s profit of $1,084,17.48 highlight key markets, while Philadelphia’s lower sales of $109,077.01 point to areas needing improvement.

Financial Metrics (Gross Sales, Gross Profit): These metrics are essential for quantifying performance and identifying trends. For example, the gross profit of copiers at $551,817.32 underscores the profitability of specific sub-categories.

Data Limitations or Biases

Missing Contextual Data

Aggregation Bias

Sample Bias: The data may not be representative of all customer segments or regions if certain groups are underrepresented in the dataset. For example, if the home office segment has fewer transactions due to lower marketing efforts, its potential may be underestimated.

Missing Variables: Key variables such as customer demographics (e.g., age, income level), purchase frequency, or marketing spend are not included. These could provide deeper insights into why certain segments or regions underperform (e.g., lack of targeted advertising in Philadelphia).

DATA SPLITING AND PREPROCESSING

DATA CLEANING: this is when the data is free from errors dataset ensures accuracy and reliability in analysis and which include;

Removing duplicates

Correcting errors

Standardizing data format

Data Transformations: Transformations were applied to prepare the data for better interpretation and analysis.

Data splitting: This involve the splitting of data point into two category independent and dependent variable.

· Independent variable are those variable that can stand alone i.e your name, and can still make meaning.

· Dependent variable are those variable that can’t stand alone they won’t make any meaning until they are attached to something e.g revenue, quantity.
